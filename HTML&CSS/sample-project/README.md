##Bootstrap
- docs are very good
- you can change your default colors/theme settings by filling this out, downloading the css, and adding the css file AFTER you link to the bootstrap css file: [bootstrap magic](https://pikock.github.io/bootstrap-magic/app/index.html#!/editor)

-note, the fonts are in a folder `app` because the bootstrap hosted library wasn't linking to them properly (i think it's a bug), so i put them in the relative path they were expected to be in. normally i wouldn't have that folder and just add any fonts i need into: `sample-project/assets/fonts`.

##hosted libraries

get javascript and css links to hosted libraries here: [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/):

- bootstrap (css and js)
- jquery
- jquery-ui

jquery docs are also VERY good. This is a nice interface for accessing them quickly: 
[jquery reference](http://oscarotero.com/jquery/)

example for docs form jquery UI: sortable (used in this example)
[jquery-ui sortable](http://jqueryui.com/sortable/)
