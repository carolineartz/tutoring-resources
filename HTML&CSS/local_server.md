#Starting a simple local http server

- In terminal, navigate to the root directory of your `github.io` site (or the root directory of whatever project)
- enter this command into your terminal to start you local server. (Macs ship with Python so you shouldn't have to install anything.) 


```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

You can now access your site in your browser on your computer on port 8000: `localhost:8000`

See the mobile_access.md file for how to accss your site on your mobile device over localhost during development.
